This package helps you highlight places in your articles
and make sure it looks nice. Install it from CTAN and then
use like this:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
\scriptsize
\raggedcolumns
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tbd}
\begin{document}
The budget is \tbd{99.00 USD}.
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

\columnbreak

The budget is \tbd{99.00 USD}.

\end{multicols}

With this package it's also possible to highlight \tbd{larger pieces of text that take
a few lines} on the page.

If you want to hide the content of what's inside \ff{\char`\\tbd},
use \ff{hide} option of the package. They will all be replaced with
\tbd{TBD} placeholders.

If you want them to disappear entirely, use the \ff{off} package option.

More details about this package you can find
in the \ff{yegor256/tbd} GitHub repository.
